# AutoGluon_Project
This project was part of my thesis project

This project is about implementing AutoGluon on the IBM HR Data Employee Attrition Dataset and obtaining the best machine learning model to then compare with several machine learning models built by Kaggle Grandmaster on the same dataset

on December 15 2023, this project was declared complete after I completed the final trial exam with several revisions which can be seen in the TestAutoGluon_Final script
